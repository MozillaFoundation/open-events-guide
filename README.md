# Welcome to the Open Events Guide Repo

The Open Events Guide is a Lightweight, easy to use, text-based standalone guide to building open events of all kinds. This Guide should help you create more inviting and productive community events. It’s great for first-timers and veteran event planners alike. It was created by staff at Mozilla, drawing our extensive experience with open events. 

[The Guide lives on the Mozilla Foundation website.](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/open-events-guide/) 

This repo is here for feedback on the guide--- comments, improvements, additions. [See our issues tab to pitch in.](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/open-events-guide/issues) We’d love your input!
